This application uses Swift in XCode, so you need to have a Mac product in order to view the code.
This code also uses Firebase, a database the was developed through google and completely free, and cocopods, which is where all the pods come from in the program.


1. Open XCode, if you do not have XCode follow the steps below that are between 1 and 2.

    a. Go to the App Store and type in Xcode. The app looks like a blueprint "A" with a hammer, click the download button.           This app requires a lot of memory, and will take time to download. Once you have downloaded it you can then open the app        by searching for it using the search icon.  
    
2. Cocopods need to be installed in your terminal before you are able to compile and manipute the code. Follow the link https://cocoapods.org to install into your terminal. Then you have to go into the folder the project is in and write "$ pod install" into the terminal ($ is the name of your terminal). This will isntall all the pods in the project.
    
3. To download firebase follow the link https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli . If you would like more information about how we added firebase to our project follow the link, https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup , this will go step by step on how to add it to your iOS project.

4. Now all the appropriate materials are downloaded, you can download the 'realJsonParsing' folder. The file that you will need to open in order to run the program is the 'realJsonParsing.xcodeproj'. When you open that in Xcode there will be a small play button on the upper left side of the program. When you click on that it will run the program.
